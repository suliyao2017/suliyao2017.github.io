I study earthquake source processes using seismic observations and numerical simulations. My research interests include near-source seismic data modeling, heterogenous earthquake rupture and seismic radiation, fault frictional properties, and earthquake rupture scenario simulations. </p> <p>I got my bachelor degree in Geophysics from <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)</a> in 2017. During 2017-2022, I went to Hong Kong and did my Ph.D. in the <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)</a>, supervised by <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/sci/essc/yang/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Hongfeng Yang</a>. Now I am a Psotdoc in the Geology Lab of ENS in Paris, working with <a href="https://harshasbhat.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Harsha Bhat</a> and <a href="https://www.ah-ha.fr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Hideo Aochi</a>.</p> </body></html>
