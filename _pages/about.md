Hi, I am a seisemologist. I study earthquake source processes using seismic observations and numerical simulations. My research interests include near-source seismic data modeling, heterogenous earthquake rupture and seismic radiation, fault frictional properties, and earthquake rupture scenario simulations. 

I got my bachelor degree in Geophysics from <a href='https://en.ustc.edu.cn/'>University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)</a> in 2017. During 2017-2022, I went to Hong Kong and did my Ph.D. in the <a href='https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html'>The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)</a>, supervised by <a href='https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/sci/essc/yang/'>Dr. Hongfeng Yang</a>. Now I am a Psotdoc in the Geology Lab of ENS in Paris, working with <a href='https://harshasbhat.github.io/'>Dr. Harsha Bhat</a> and <a href='https://www.ah-ha.fr/'>Dr. Hideo Aochi</a>.
